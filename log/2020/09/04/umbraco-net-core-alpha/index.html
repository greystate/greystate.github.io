<abbr class="date" title="2020-09-04T22:11:11+0200"><a rel="bookmark" href="https://greystate.dk/log/2020/09/04/umbraco-net-core-alpha/"><time datetime="2020-09-04T22:11:11+0200">4 Sep, 2020</time></a></abbr>

<p>Many times since I started using Umbraco (some 11 years ago), I’ve been in
situations where it’d have been nice (read: not so risky) to be able to run a
local development version of an Umbraco website. But it’s never been possible on
a Mac, unless you were using a VM or something similar. So I’ve had a Windows
laptop on hand for these occasions.</p>

<p>So when I learned that now there was an alpha version available that people had
apparently been able to run natively on macOS I was all “where do I sign my name
and get a copy of it?”</p>

<h2 id="hands-on">Hands on</h2>

<p>Getting my hands on the actual alpha release was not difficult -
<a href="https://umbraco.com/blog/net-core-alpha-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this blogpost on umbraco.com</a>
gave me the initial pointers. I didn’t do the CLI stuff since I already had
Visual Studio for Mac installed and figured I’d try using that.</p>

<p>The actual steps I followed were these:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Download and <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">install the .NET Core 3.1 installer</a>
from Microsoft’s site</p></li>
<li>
<p>Add the custom NuGet feed as described</p>

<pre><code class="lang-bash">dotnet nuget add source "https://www.myget.org/F/umbracoprereleases/api/v3/index.json" -n "Umbraco Prereleases"
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install the Umbraco dotnet template</p>

<pre><code class="lang-bash">dotnet new -i Umbraco.Templates::0.5.0-alpha001
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Created a new empty solution</p>

<pre><code class="lang-bash">dotnet new umbraco -n UmbraMaco
</code></pre>

<p>(yes, I chose a better name than <em>MyCustomUmbracoSolution</em> :-))</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>At this point, the blogpost boldly states that I can
<em>“open the newly created project in [my] favourite IDE”</em> - while Visual Studio
isn’t exactly “my favourite”, it’s probably the only IDE I have that’ll open a
.NET project, so I went ahead and did just that.</p>

<h2 id="roadblock(s)-ahead">Roadblock(s) ahead</h2>

<p>As soon as I opened the project, I could tell from the red messages that
something wasn’t all well. I managed to quite quickly (and I’m very proud of
this, as I have no idea how stuff works in Visual Studio) figure out that even
though I’d added the custom NuGet feed on the command-line, that Visual Studio
wanted its own instruction about this. So I found out where to specify NuGet
feeds and added it in. Then I hit reload (or what ever it says on the button
that makes the project refresh its packages etc.)</p>

<p>Lo and behold, there was a total lack of red messages and I challenged myself
to press the Play button…</p>

<p>I was treated with a pile of messages flying by, and eventually the familiar
install screen opening in a web browser, and I typed my name and my email
address and came up with “a very good password” (TM) and slammed my head into
the next roadblock…</p>

<h2 id="it’s-a-database.-we-base-all-our-data-on-it.">It’s a database. We base all our data on it.</h2>

<p>I’ve installed Umbraco hundreds of times so I don’t know why I was suddenly
confused about the next screen, where I was tasked with the (seemingly) simple
job of choosing whether to use <strong>Microsoft SQL</strong> or <em>something Azure’y</em>, or
maybe I had a custom Connection String I’d like to use for the database to use
for this Umbraco site?</p>

<p>I think I’d been counting on SQL-CE being available, but as I’d have know, had I
read the rest of the blogpost, SQL-CE is a Windows-only requirement, so isn’t
installed by default.</p>

<p>I did some DuckDuckGo-ing (aka Google-ing, <em>ed.</em>) and saw the words <strong>Docker</strong>
and <strong>Container</strong> and my mind went blank…</p>

<p>I closed the browser and shut down Visual Studio and went for a walk with the
dog.</p>

<h2 id="when-in-doubt,-read-tweets">When in doubt, read tweets</h2>

<p>Returning from the walk, I saw
<a href="https://twitter.com/pjengaard/status/1301617397900759040" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a tweet from René Pjengaard</a>
and I replied that I was stuck. Of course, the friendly neighbourhood Spider-Men
of Umbraco friends immediately rose to the rescue by confirming my earlier
findings - to try using Docker and get an instance of MSSQL running in there.
So I got back in the saddle and whipped open “the download program”
(web browser, <em>ed.</em>).</p>

<h2 id="how-did-i-get-it-to-work?">How did I get it to work?</h2>

<p>From <a href="https://database.guide/how-to-install-sql-server-on-a-mac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post</a> that’s
a couple of years old, I got the basics of how to use Docker and install MSSQL.</p>

<p>I also managed to launch the Docker image and then I had another
“<strong>Finding Nemo</strong> After the End Credits Sequence” - “Now What?” moment
(https://twitter.com/greystate/status/1301634901696020480)</p>

<p>But then I thought, “What the heck” - the thing is running (it says) so maybe I
can try with <strong>SQLPro</strong>? (It’s one of
<a href="http://www.macsqlclient.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a suite of native Mac apps</a> for working with
databases that I got from the Mac App Store). I’ve used the app for connecting
to Umbraco Cloud databases on and off, so it just might work?</p>

<p>I tried connecting to it by specifying <code>localhost</code> as the server and providing
the credentials and it worked! (Yes, I’m an experienced developer and I google
stuff and I was utterly surprised to <em>actually</em> see this work).</p>

<p>All that was left was to create a database and then restart the Umbraco site
from Visual Studio.</p>

<p>And then I got all the way to the familiar Umbraco Backoffice, but running
locally on my Mac. Surreal for real.</p>
