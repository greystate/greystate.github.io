<p>I wrote a post in March last year about my intent of reading a lot more than I’d
been doing lately. Consider this a late follow-up :)</p>

<p>After <strong>“The Silence of the Lambs”</strong>, I spent April reading <strong>“Ready Player One”</strong>
by Ernest Cline — a rather fantastic story that I’d heard a lot about. I enjoyed
that very much and subsequently watched the Spielberg film. I enjoyed the film
too and didn’t really have a problem with the many changes made (it was a crazy
project to film this story in the first place).</p>

<p>In May I read an old favorite of mine - <strong>“Watchers”</strong> by Dean R. Koontz. I love
this story - it’s super suspenseful and hard to put down. Which is also why I
managed to cram an extra title into May; I had received the screenplay for my
favorite movie <strong>“The Prestige”</strong> - by Christopher Nolan (the screenplay is
written by Christopher and Jonathan Nolan). I’ve read the original book by
Christopher Priest as well years ago and it’s another absolute fave of mine.</p>

<p>In June I started reading another Dean R. Koontz thriller - <strong>“Midnight”</strong>, but
I didn’t get to finish it until sometime in July.</p>
